# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement CTRadon - Filtered Backprojection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Filtered Backprojection (FBP) method. Apply filter to sinogram before backprojection to remove blurriness. Function takes sinogram and angle range as input. May use OpenCV's getRotationMatrix2D and warpAffine. Cannot use skimage's iradon in implementation (only for comparison). Works only for parallel projection.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Sinogram Filtering Process [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the filtering process to apply to the sinogram before backprojection.
### Details:
Use a suitable filter to process the sinogram data to reduce blurriness. Ensure compatibility with parallel projection.

## 2. Develop Backprojection Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the backprojection algorithm to reconstruct the image from the filtered sinogram.
### Details:
Implement the backprojection using OpenCV's getRotationMatrix2D and warpAffine. Avoid using skimage's iradon.

## 3. Handle Input and Output for FBP Function [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Design the input and output handling for the Filtered Backprojection function.
### Details:
Ensure the function accepts sinogram and angle range as inputs and outputs the reconstructed image.

## 4. Test and Validate FBP Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Conduct thorough testing and validation of the entire Filtered Backprojection implementation.
### Details:
Develop test cases to validate the accuracy and performance of the FBP method. Use skimage's iradon for comparison.
