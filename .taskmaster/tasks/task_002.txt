# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement CTSlice - Direct Fourier Reconstruction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Direct Fourier Reconstruction method using Fourier Slice Theorem. Function takes sinogram and angle range (180° or 360°) as input and returns reconstructed CT slice. Must use fftshift/ifftshift for correct phase information. Works only for parallel projection.
