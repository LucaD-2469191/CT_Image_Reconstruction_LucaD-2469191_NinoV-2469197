# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement CTSlice - Direct Fourier Reconstruction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Direct Fourier Reconstruction method using Fourier Slice Theorem. Function takes sinogram and angle range (180° or 360°) as input and returns reconstructed CT slice. Must use fftshift/ifftshift for correct phase information. Works only for parallel projection.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Fourier Slice Theorem [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core algorithm using the Fourier Slice Theorem for CT reconstruction.
### Details:
Use FFT to transform the sinogram, apply the Fourier Slice Theorem, and ensure correct phase information with fftshift/ifftshift.

## 2. Handle Input/Output for CTSlice Function [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Design the function interface to accept sinogram and angle range, and output the reconstructed CT slice.
### Details:
Ensure the function accepts inputs for sinogram and angle range (180° or 360°) and outputs the reconstructed image.

## 3. Test CTSlice with Sample Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Validate the implementation using sample sinograms and compare results with expected outputs.
### Details:
Use sample sinograms to test the reconstruction accuracy and performance of the CTSlice function.
