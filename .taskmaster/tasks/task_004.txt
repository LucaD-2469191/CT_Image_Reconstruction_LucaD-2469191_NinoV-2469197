# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Rebinning algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement rebinning to convert divergent projection (fan-beam) sinograms to parallel projection sinograms. Function takes sinogram and parameters (FOD, FDD, sensor width, center offset) as input. Must account for Y-axis pointing downward in image coordinate systems. Output is rebinned sinogram usable by CTSlice and CTRadon.
