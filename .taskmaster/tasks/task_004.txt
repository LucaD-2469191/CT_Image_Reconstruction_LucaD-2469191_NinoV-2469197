# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Rebinning algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement rebinning to convert divergent projection (fan-beam) sinograms to parallel projection sinograms. Function takes sinogram and parameters (FOD, FDD, sensor width, center offset) as input. Must account for Y-axis pointing downward in image coordinate systems. Output is rebinned sinogram usable by CTSlice and CTRadon.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research Rebinning Process [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Understand the mathematical and computational aspects of rebinning from fan-beam to parallel-beam sinograms.
### Details:
Study relevant literature and existing algorithms for rebinning. Focus on the transformation of coordinates and handling of input parameters like FOD, FDD, sensor width, and center offset.

## 2. Implement Core Rebinning Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the core algorithm to convert fan-beam sinograms to parallel-beam sinograms.
### Details:
Use insights from research to implement the algorithm. Ensure the Y-axis is correctly oriented downward in the image coordinate system. Validate the output against expected parallel-beam sinograms.

## 3. Handle Edge Cases in Rebinning [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Identify and implement solutions for potential edge cases in the rebinning process.
### Details:
Consider scenarios such as extreme values of FOD, FDD, and center offset. Ensure robustness against unusual input configurations.

## 4. Develop Testing Suite for Rebinning Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive testing suite to validate the rebinning algorithm.
### Details:
Design unit tests and integration tests to cover typical and edge case scenarios. Ensure compatibility with CTSlice and CTRadon outputs.
