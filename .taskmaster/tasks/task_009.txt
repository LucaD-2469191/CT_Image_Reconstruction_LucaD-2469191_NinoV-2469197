# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement extra features (optional)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: For higher grade: (1) Auto-detect if sinogram is 180° or 360°, (2) Auto-detect if sensor images are stacked horizontally or vertically, (3) Implement additional filter methods for FBP.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Auto-Detection for Sinogram Angle [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a feature to auto-detect if a sinogram is 180° or 360°.
### Details:
Create an algorithm to analyze sinogram data and determine the angle range. Use statistical methods to differentiate between 180° and 360° sinograms.

## 2. Implement Auto-Detection for Sensor Image Orientation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a feature to auto-detect if sensor images are stacked horizontally or vertically.
### Details:
Analyze image metadata and pixel patterns to determine orientation. Implement logic to handle both horizontal and vertical stacking.

## 3. Develop Additional Filter Methods for FBP [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement new filter methods for the Filtered Backprojection (FBP) process.
### Details:
Research and implement additional filters such as Hamming and Hann. Integrate these filters into the existing FBP workflow.
